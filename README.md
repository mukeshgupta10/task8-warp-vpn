# Task 8: Working with VPNs (Using Cloudflare WARP)

## 🔧 What I Used
- VPN Tool: Cloudflare WARP (1.1.1.1 VPN)
- Platform: Windows / Android
- Free, Fast, Encrypted DNS and VPN tunnel

## 🔍 Steps Performed
- Enabled WARP from the app
- Verified IP address change using `whatismyipaddress.com`
- Confirmed secure encrypted connection via browser padlock
- Compared speed with and without VPN

## 📸 Screenshots
- WARP Connection (ON)
- IP address before/after VPN

## ✅ VPN Benefits
- Encrypts internet traffic
- Hides real IP address
- Bypasses some geo restrictions
- Free and easy to use

## ⚠️ VPN Limitations
- No manual server selection
- May not work for all region-restricted content (e.g., Netflix USA)
- Doesn’t offer full anonymity like advanced paid VPNs

## 📚 Key Concepts
- VPN: Virtual Private Network
- Encryption: Secures data transfer
- Tunneling Protocol: WARP uses WireGuard
- Privacy: VPN hides user identity from ISPs

## 📎 Interview Prep (WARP Specific)
- WARP uses WireGuard, a fast and secure protocol.
- Unlike traditional VPNs, it routes only some traffic (split-tunneling).

## 💡 Interesting Observation:
Using WARP VPN **increased my internet speed** instead of reducing it.

### ⚙️ Why?
- WARP uses **Cloudflare's smart routing**
- It bypasses **ISP throttling**
- Uses the **WireGuard protocol**, which is faster and more efficient

📈 Tested using: https://fast.com
- Speed with WARP: 38 Mbps
- Speed without WARP: 27 Mbps
